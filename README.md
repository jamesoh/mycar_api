and store into their collection of cars. This collection of 
cars is referred to as MyGarage, a personal garage for each 
user that stores the data for each car they add. 

API:
This application has a built in API for returning the data in 
a user's MyGarage in JSON format.
  
  Usage: http://hostname/a/pag/:pag\_id/users/:id

This application was based on 
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
